## How to compile:

Type “make” into the terminal.
Type “make -B” if you want to force it to compile
Basically, it’ll check the timestamp to see if time has passed when deciding whether to compile or not. But since we’re using a cloud, timing is all weird. So use -B to force it to compile
Type cd created
Type ./game into the console to run
